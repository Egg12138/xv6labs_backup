# xv6

This is my lab solution for MIT course 6.S081(2021).

For solutions for each lab check out different branches.

Don't check out the main branch - it's combination of code from all labs. Although it could compile, it's not guaranteed to be bug-free.

For old readme see [README](README).

## Writeup

Still work in progress...
