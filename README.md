# xv6

This is my lab solution for MIT course 6.S081(2021).

For solutions for different labs checkout different branches. Don't bother with main branch - it's a combination of solution of all labs. Though it could compile, it's not guaranteed to work.

For old readme see [README](README).

## Writeup

Still work in progress...
