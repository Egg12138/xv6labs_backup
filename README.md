# xv6

This is my lab solution for MIT course 6.S081(2021).

For solutions for each lab check out different **tags**. Don't bother with branches - all branches are merged into main branch and those code are **not** guaranteed to work.

For old readme see [README](README).

## Writeup

Still work in progress...
