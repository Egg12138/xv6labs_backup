Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?

参数寄存器：a0, a1, a2...

Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)

`auipc` + `jalr`指令组合用于call libc函数。f和g都被inline了。

At what address is the function printf located?

`0x0000000000000628`

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?

pc值。

Run the following code.

```c
	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
```

What is the output?

`He110 World`

In the following code, what is going to be printed after `'y='`? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

```
	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
```

寄存器a2的值。
